# Flowork Governance Model

This document outlines the governance structure for the **Flowork Project**. Our goal is to build the world's best **Hybrid AI Operating System** through transparency, collaboration, and strong technical leadership.

---

## 1. Overview

Flowork is an open-source project managed by the **Flowork Core Team**. While we encourage community contributions, the project adheres to a strict architectural vision (Hybrid Cloud + Local Engine) to ensure security, privacy, and performance.

### Guiding Principles
* **Privacy First:** We will never compromise the "Local Engine" architecture. User data stays local.
* **Hybrid Efficiency:** We prioritize solutions that balance Cloud convenience with Local power.
* **Meritocracy:** Influence is earned through active, high-quality contributions.

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

### 👥 Users
Community members who use Flowork, report bugs, and request features. Users are the heartbeat of the project, and their feedback drives our roadmap.

### 🛠️ Contributors
Anyone who submits a Pull Request (PR), updates documentation, or helps triage issues. Contributors are listed in the commit history and are eligible to become Maintainers over time.

### 🔑 Maintainers
Contributors who have shown dedication and technical expertise. Maintainers have the authority to:
* Review and merge Pull Requests.
* Triage and label issues.
* Manage the repository roadmap.

### 👑 The Core Team (Steering Committee)
The original creators and lead architects of Flowork. The Core Team retains the **Final Decision-Making Authority** on:
* Major architectural changes.
* Release schedules (Versioning).
* Adding or removing Maintainers.
* Resolving conflicts that cannot be settled by consensus.

> **Current Project Lead:** [Flowork Team](https://github.com/flowork-dev)

## 3. Decision Making Process

### Feature Requests
Minor changes (bug fixes, small UI tweaks) can be merged by any Maintainer.

### Major Architectural Changes (RFCs)
For significant changes (e.g., changing the WebSocket protocol, adding a new AI Provider system), the process is as follows:
1.  **Open an Issue/RFC:** Describe the proposal in detail using the "Feature Request" template.
2.  **Discussion:** The community and Maintainers debate the technical merits.
3.  **Consensus:** We aim for consensus. If no consensus is reached, the **Core Team** makes the final decision based on the project's long-term vision.

---

## 4. Release Cycle

Flowork follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
* **Major (1.0.0):** Breaking changes to the Engine/GUI protocol.
* **Minor (1.1.0):** New features (e.g., new AI nodes, widgets) that are backward-compatible.
* **Patch (1.0.1):** Bug fixes and security patches.

## 5. Conflict Resolution

We adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). In the event of a dispute:
1.  Parties should try to resolve it professionally.
2.  If unresolved, the issue should be escalated to the Core Team via **conduct@flowork.cloud**.
3.  The Core Team's decision is final.
